# CarPrice_Analysis
My second assignment on car price data
It is my first data science assignment where I first import the data. Then some data problems by feature engineering, scaling, and outliers treatment.Did some EDA and then started with a baseline model (Linear regression) and then went on with multiple models. The final output was with accuracy.
